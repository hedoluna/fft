// Create processor instance
AudioSignalProcessor processor = new AudioSignalProcessor();

// Apply filters
double[] signal = ...; // Your audio signal
double[] filtered = processor.applyFilter(signal, "vocal", null, 44100.0);

// Analyze audio characteristics
AudioSignalProcessor.AudioMetrics metrics = processor.analyzeSignal(signal, 44100.0);
System.out.println("Fundamental frequency: " + metrics.getFundamentalFrequency() + " Hz");

// Add reverb effect
double[] withReverb = processor.addReverb(signal, 1.5, 44100.0); // 1.5s reverb time

// Reduce noise
double[] noiseProfile = ...; // Noise-only segment
double[] denoised = processor.reduceNoise(noisySignal, noiseProfile, 44100.0, 2.0);

## Technical Details

### Filter Implementations

#### Low-pass Filter
```java
// Butterworth-style low-pass with 10% of Nyquist cutoff
double cutoff = sampleRate * 0.1;
double attenuation = 1.0 / (1.0 + Math.pow(frequency / cutoff, 4));
```

#### High-pass Filter
```java
// High-pass with 5% of Nyquist cutoff
double cutoff = sampleRate * 0.05;
double attenuation = Math.pow(frequency / cutoff, 2);
```

#### Vocal Enhancement
- Passband: 80-4000 Hz (vocal frequency range)
- Optimized for speech and singing voice enhancement
- Preserves formant structures while attenuating noise

#### 60Hz Notch Filter
- Targets power line interference (60Hz Â± 5Hz)
- Minimal impact on adjacent frequencies
- Essential for clean audio recording

### Noise Reduction Algorithm

Uses spectral subtraction technique:
1. Analyze noise profile spectrum
2. Subtract scaled noise spectrum from signal
3. Apply spectral floor to prevent artifacts
4. Reconstruct time-domain signal

```java
double subtractedMag = originalMag - alpha * noiseMag;
double finalMag = Math.max(subtractedMag, 0.1 * originalMag); // 10% floor
```

### Reverb Processing

Implements convolution-based reverb:
1. Generate exponential decay impulse response
2. Add early reflection modulation
3. Convolve with input signal using FFT
4. Mix wet and dry signals

### Audio Metrics

#### Spectral Centroid
Frequency center of mass:
```java
centroid = Î£(frequency[i] * magnitude[i]) / Î£(magnitude[i])
```

#### Spectral Spread
Frequency distribution width around centroid:
```java
spread = âˆš(Î£((frequency[i] - centroid)Â² * magnitude[i]) / Î£(magnitude[i]))
```

#### Spectral Rolloff
Frequency below which 95% of energy is contained.
