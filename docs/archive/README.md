## Why These Were Archived

### Criteria for Archival:
1. **Completed Work**: Documentation of finished tasks (cleanups, fixes, issues)
2. **Superseded**: Newer, more comprehensive documents available
3. **Historical Planning**: Detailed plans for work now completed
4. **Duplicate Content**: 80%+ overlap with authoritative sources
5. **Outdated Status**: Status snapshots from months ago

### Preservation Rationale:
- **Git History**: Full version control available
- **Reference Value**: Historical context for future developers
- **Audit Trail**: Track evolution of project decisions
- **Learning**: Understand what approaches worked/didn't work
